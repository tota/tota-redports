Package RODBC implements ODBC database connectivity.

Two groups of functions are provided. The mainly internal odbc*
commands implement low-level access to the ODBC functions of similar
name. The sql* functions operate at a higher level to read, save,
copy and manipulate data between data frames and SQL tables. Many
connections can be open at once to any combination of DSN/hosts.
