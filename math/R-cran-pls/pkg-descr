pls is an R package implementing partial least squares regression
(PLSR) and principal component regression (PCR). The package is
written by Ron Wehrens and Bjrn-Helge Mevik. It started as a merge
of Ron's earlier package `pls.pcr' and an unpublished package by
Bjrn-Helge.

Features:

 * several algorithms: the traditional orthogonal scores (NIPALS)
   PLS algorithm, kernel PLS, wide kernel PLS, Simpls and PCR through
   svd
 * supports multi-response models (aka PLS2)
 * flexible cross-validation
 * Jackknife variance estimates of regression coefficients
 * extensive and flexible plots: scores, loadings, predictions,
   coefficients, (R)MSEP, R^2, correlation loadings
 * formula interface, modelled after lm(), with methods for predict,
   print, summary, plot, update, etc.
 * extraction functions for coefficients, scores and loadings
 * MSEP, RMSEP and R^2 estimates
 * multiplicative scatter correction (MSC)
