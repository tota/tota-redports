This package provides functions for computing the density and the
distribution function of multivariate normal and multivariate "t"
variates, and for generating random vectors sampled from these
distributions. Probabilities are computed via a non-Monte Carlo
method; different routines are used for the case d=1, d=2, d>2, if
d denotes the number of dimensions.
