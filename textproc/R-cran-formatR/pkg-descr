This package provides a function tidy.source() and optionally a GUI
(by gWidgets and preferably gWidgetsRGtk2) to format R source code.
Spaces and indent will be added to the code automatically, and
comments will be preserved under certain conditions, so that R code
will be more human-readable and tidy.
